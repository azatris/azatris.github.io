## Introduction

When reasonably smart people believe in a deity, the rationale is usually communicated to others as a variation of "you don't know that God doesn't exist" in combination with "I feel it's right for me". [adjust this paragraph]

It was the same for me. I was practically not believing anything I didn't need to believe, but despite that I felt that the idea of God fit with me and my values. It also felt right to have something _beyond the mere normal_, something that gives a bigger context to your daily life and self-identity.

I didn't need to _believe_. I just sensed and felt that _there is something_. This was sufficient for me to entangle myself with many other concepts that usually come in a bundle with modern spirituality: _enlightenment_, _karma_, _mantras_, _thoughts are wishes_, et cetera, et cetera which have questionable relation to reality.

I also didn't care what other people really thought of this. It was _mine_, _I_ felt it and I found the concepts beautifully matching up like a jigsaw puzzle. 

With this experience I may never label spiritual or religious people stupid _a priori_, knowing how easy it is to build logical systems out of some foundations that may not actually be grounded in reality. And this phenomenon is easy to miss if you don't have the correct knowledge.

## The Knowledge

### Knowledge of Biases

A significant source of confusion is that if you believe in God, and are dedicated, you **will** find experiences that support this belief.

I was involved with spirituality with ties to Hinduism. When I chanted the mantra _"Om Namah Shivaya" (salutations to Shiva)_, my mind cleared up, I immediately felt better, my worries dissapeared for the moment. I felt more connected to my concept of _Life_.

[mention the ease of fooling yourself]

The problem isn't the experiences, but rather that I was under the effect of [Confirmation Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias):

> It is the peculiar and perpetual error of the human understanding to be more moved and excited by affirmatives than by negatives. 

> &mdash; [Francis Bacon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Bacon)

It's not necessarily that I was looking for affirmative experiences and disregarding negatives, but it is harder to notice these negatives when you have trust. Should I wish God to help me acquire a particular experience X - if that happens, that's an affirmation - if it doesn't happen, then _it's my karma and I have to 'resolve' it_. This sort of unfalsifiability creates a serious [Selection Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) of interpretation of experience.

### Knowledge of Bayesian Probability

The thing with reality is that it should yield evidence for it existing. 

If a phenomenon (the subject of the hypothesis) doesn't provide any experience, whether we consider it still reality or not _does not matter_, because we are **only** concerned with that which we can interact with, that which has a nonzero potential to affect even a single atom in our body. Otherwise such phenomena are as important to us as not existing at all.

This is the [Bayes' theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes'_theorem):

$$\mathbb{P}(H|E) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(E|H)\mathbb{P}(H)}{\mathbb{P}(E)}$$

>If you are unfamiliar with probability theory or the Bayes' theorem, you should at least know that the Bayesian probability model is in one-to-one correspondence with reality. It is testable, verifiable, and very real. 

>Hypothesis (H) is a proposition made as a basis for reasoning, without any assumption of its truth.

>Evidence (E) is that which supports the hypothesis.

><span>$$\mathbb{P}(H)$$</span> stands for our prior knowledge of the probability of hypothesis H, having seen no evidence.

><span>$$\mathbb{P}(E)$$</span> stands for our prior knowledge of the probability of encountering evidence E, regardless of hyptheses.

><span>$$\mathbb{P}(E|H)$$</span> stands for our initial knowledge of the probability of encountering evidence E, given that we know that hypothesis H holds true.

><span>$$\mathbb{P}(H|E)$$</span> is the probability of hypothesis H holding true having encountered evidence E.

What makes this theorem wonderful is that in order to prove a nonzero <span>$$\mathbb{P}(H|E)$$</span>, I also must have a nonzero <span>$$\mathbb{P}(E|H)$$</span>. In other words, in order to have any nonzero probability for the hypothesis _"God is real (given all the evidence in the universe)"_, I **must** expect _at least some_ evidence of that _given God is truly real_. This means that I must be able to _in principle_ able to reproduce the results (without [reproducibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility) it is as unreliable as someone just _telling me_ this).

Knowing this, could I truly say that there is even a tiny spark of evidence to support belief in God? The prior <span>$$\mathbb{P}(H)$$</span> (for example, my intuition) does not help me here enough. With _feeling things_ there are so many stronger hypotheses than the existence of God as the cause.
