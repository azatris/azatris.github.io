title: God (or How I Got Rid of the Doubt)

## Introduction

When reasonably smart people believe in a deity, the rationale is usually communicated to others as a variation of "you don't know that God doesn't exist" in combination with "I feel it's right for me". [adjust this paragraph]

It was the same for me. I was practically not believing anything I didn't need to believe, but despite that I felt that the idea of God fit with me and my values. It also felt right to have something _beyond the mere normal_, something that gives a bigger context to your daily life and self-identity.

I didn't need to _believe_. I just sensed and felt that _there is something_. This was sufficient for me to entangle myself with many other concepts that usually come in a bundle with modern spirituality: _enlightenment_, _karma_, _mantras_, _thoughts are wishes_, et cetera, et cetera which have questionable relation to reality.

I also didn't care what other people really thought of this. It was _mine_, _I_ felt it and I found the concepts beautifully matching up like a jigsaw puzzle. 

With this experience I may never label spiritual or religious people stupid _a priori_, knowing how easy it is to build logical systems out of some foundations that may not actually be grounded in reality. And this phenomenon is easy to miss if you don't have the correct knowledge.

## The Knowledge

A significant source of confusion is that if you believe in God, and are dedicated, you **will** find experiences that support this belief.

I was involved with spirituality with ties to Hinduism. When I chanted the mantra _"Om Namah Shivaya" (salutations to Shiva)_, my mind cleared up, I immediately felt better, my worries dissapeared for the moment. I felt more connected to my concept of _Life_.
