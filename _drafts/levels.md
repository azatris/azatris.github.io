title: Kegan's Levels (or Constructive Developmental Theory)
---

## Introduction

As soon as I stumbled on people talking about Kegan's levels, it captured my curiosity: _"finally, a coherent theory of self-development!"_. My hopes were of course immediately towards actually being able to _use it_. 

The core idea of the theory is that there are 5 developmental levels where you are categorized into. The levels are mutually exclusive, but you aren't strictly pigeonholed into a particular level and usually in a transition from one to another.

Each level is defined by your ability to regard particular _aspects_ of your life as an **object**, rather than being completely **subjected to** it and thus being unable to reflect on them. 

These _aspects_ of life are described by Berger [1] as _aspects of meaning constructing_. I believe that _meaning_ here is synonymous to _values_ as an **object** and _subconsciously identifying with_ when **subjected to**. The aspects are as follows:

* reflexes (1st level object object) 
* impulses, perceptions (2nd level object, 1st level subject) 
* needs, interests, desires (3rd level object, 2nd level subject) 
* interpersonal relationships, mutuality (4th level object, 3rd level subject) 
* self-authorship, identity, ideology (5th level object, 4th level subject)

(Clearly the list are simply labels which don't do much in helping to embrace the full extent of what is seen as an object on each level. There's an image of a table that uses these labels, but neither the table or the diagrams seem to provide much value, unless you already understand the theory, but here it is anyway: [5 stages of development](http://i.imgur.com/K4AVFbW.png).)

What makes the theory _constructive_ and _developmental_ is that each level builds on the object-level understanding of the previous level, thus _developing_ to higher levels can be seen as _constructing_ understanding of reality. It's like 5 matryoshka dolls inside each other.

## Level 0/1

The first level usually only governs small children, in which there are no rules, no laws seeming to govern reality. Everything is an extension of oneself, a playground of sorts, or a dream you cannot make sense of. Transition out of this stage is via acquiring an understanding of reality that the things you sense _might not actually be yourself after all_, but rather can continue existing after you have stopped paying attention to them.

## Level 2

The second level is the domain of mostly older children and adolescents, with adults possibly spending many years here as well. Here beliefs, rules seem rigid, and learned patterns about the world feel constant. Kegan argues that on this level the individual cannot tell lies as they cannot hold both their own perspective and another's at the same time. In a nutshell, on this level you are an selfish agent (you don't know you're selfish) acting in a world with no regard to others' motives or consequences that may come of it.  

## Level 3

The third level is where internal values come to play. The values are drawn from external influencers, and are used in decision making, including self-reflection. Should there be any conflicting ideologies or values from the influencers, you consult others how to resolve the conflicts. Dealing with the conflict, if told to resolve that yourself, you become even more confused and at a a loss than before. Since _selfishishness_ contradicts so many of the acquired external values on the third level, it is also very difficult to break out of this in order to transition to the upper level (where self-esteem comes from an independendly-constructed reality of self). The _rightness_ of a decision ultimately is judged by other agents and on this level you try your best to satisfy that. Approximately 58% of the adult population is at this level or lower. 

Case study written by Berger[1]:

>Walter is an excellent example of a Third order meaning-maker.  A responsible, hard working teacher, Walter is strongly invested in teaching as a career and in the success of his students.  He is intelligent, highly educated, and knowledgeable about his certification area of science.  He is also very reflective and curious, and he works hard to be a better teacher through continuing staff development, discussions with his colleagues, and reading books that help him make sense of the complexities of a difficult profession.  He is strongly invested in being a success as a teacher, and he wishes he were confident about “doing the right thing.”

>Walter’s Third order meaning system means that he finds himself over his head, though, when he is faced with issues or decisions that require him to make independent judgments.  To know whether he’s doing a good job as a teacher, Walter turns to others.  He wants a class where “there’s not any more argument from the students” and barring that, wants at least “to find support from the…other teachers or…[be able] to relay a story and to have them say, ‘I thought you handled that well.’”  Without such positive feedback, he asks, “What’s the meaning of life here?”  Part of the necessity for the feedback is that without it Walter has no way to decide whether he was a successful teacher.  “It’s just a mystery,” he says.  

>The meaning system Walter is embedded in is his role as a teacher.  While someone at the Fourth order might be able to coordinate multiple views of himself simultaneously (“I am a teacher, but I’m also a father and an athlete”), Walter finds that the single role of teacher defines his life.  It is, of course, true that anyone can be a parent, a teacher, and an athlete at any order of mind.  The difference is that in the Third order, people tend to make a single role their defining role (I am a teacher who also happens to be an athlete).  In the Fourth order, the roles become more permeable and multiple. Walter, who at other times in the interview speaks of his commitment to an athletic discipline, seems not to hold on to both roles simultaneously.  Instead, he says, “I mean, my job is kind of my identity,” and if he fails at that job he will “feel crushed.” 

>Walter names some of the limits of his own understanding—some of the feeling of being in over his head—when he speaks of disliking this single role and wishing he could find a way to get away from it to “somehow strike a balance” in his life.   While a teacher at any order might find himself working too many hours and frustrated about that situation, the thing that makes Walter’s frustration Third order is his seeming lack of control over it.  He describes himself as “a slave” to “the restrictive life style” of his teaching and feels “angry…that I have to be in a profession that…just demands so much of me.”  He is frustrated with himself for his deficiencies admitting, “I don’t know how to strike that balance yet.”  Kegan’s theory predicts that as Walter continues to grow toward the Fourth order, he will find himself better able to gain perspective on his teaching and its place in his life. 

## Level 4

In the fourth level of Kegan's framework, the biggest shift comes in that the _self_ comes into existence. All of the previous ideologies, opinions, views can be viewed as objects rather than being subjected to them directly. They become managable, governable, and you can use them to further develop your own values and can correct yourself as new information comes in. The opinions of others are still taken into account, however in this level the _self_ comes into importance in making decisions. Thanks to all of this, you cannot become as confused at this level by conflicting meaning systems, because you have your own system which to make decisions with. However, should the inner meaning system be at conflict with itself, it cannot be easily resolved.

## Level 5

Kegan asserts that the fifth level is never seen before midlife. In the fifth level you have learned the limits of your inner meaning system and the limits of any identities you might hold. You start seeing more similarities and overlappings between the inner systems of other people. You deal better with controversies and paradoxes. You see problems with different decision making systems, admitting that there might also be a better one than you currently hold. One of such problems can be that your system can contribute to your inability to see better alternatives.

>Case study.  By the time Kathleen was in her early 50s, she had become chief counsel for in a large government agency.  During her fast rise through the early years in her profession, she was “much more willing, for the sake of prestige, status, intellectual challenge” not to have what she would later think of as her “whole self” engaged in her work.  While emphasizing the “whole person” and being “a leader in doing that” with her staff, Kathleen “was much less in touch with what that actually meant to me.”  While her work “mattered to me a lot and was important to do,” Kathleen never “felt like it was an expression of who I was.”

## Issue 1

And now that you've read all this...

The theory becomes kind of flat and fluffless when we simply use the core ideas from each level (taken from [2], includes 0th level, reworded for clarity):

| Level   | Philosophy   |
| -----   | ----------   |
| 0 | living in an objectless world, a world in which everything sensed is taken to be an extension of oneself |
| 1 | thinking fantastic and illogical, feelings impulsive and fluid, social-relating egocentric |
| 2 | rules, sets of directions, and dualisms give shape and structure to one's daily activity |
| 3 | other people are experienced as sources of internal validation, orientation, or authority |
| 4 | the capacity to take responsibility for and ownership of one's internal authority |
| 5 | recognizing commonalities and interdependence with others |


## Issue 2

Kegan's theory keeps emphasising how hard it is to reach level 5 and usually not before midlife and even then it's _really_ unlikely. But I dare to digress. So let's see where we are...

In order to beat level 0 all I need to do is understand that I am not everything. Umm, check.

Do I acknowledge my impulses and perceptions? Yup, definitely. Level 1 beat so that means I am now at level 2.

Can my _needs_, interests, desires be seen as an object? I really don't _need_ to answer that. Hah. Level 3.

I reason about my relationships with other people. I have a governing _self_ and if my influences disagree with me on matter of values, _I_ stay on top. I self-reflect, see problems, adjust behavior. There seems to be no way I am not at least level 4.

And finally, the mythical level 5. It seems to me that anyone who has a foundation in probability theory and has brought it into life must necessarily be at level 5. The aspects of this level: e.g. seeing the possible limits of your own meaning making system, understanding that identity is only in the brain (and any particular identity you might hold might not be best aligned with your true values), you can hold a paradox in your brain without malfunctioning (seeing that as merely your [map, not the territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map%E2%80%93territory_relation)), and being generally humble about being possibly wrong are quite normal for anyone familiar with probability and logic. Recognizing commonalities is sort of a statistical inevitability. I am not sure what is meant by _interdependence with others_, but by the sound of it, it's obvious in a society we all depend on each other. Of course it is wonderful if that is also mutually acknowledged in relationships, possibly making it resembling a symbiosis.

So that wasn't so hard, was it? I am not mid-aged.

## Issue 3

So when we flatten the ideas of each level, they are easy to obtain. Some might argue that Kegan said this and that also for a particular level, but then it becomes the problem of not being well-defined enough. But if this theory is not well-defined, then how can we really reason about it if it is so vague and open to interpretation? 

## Issue 4

If you study the theory, how can you not immediately become level 5 as a result simply by bringing the _aspects of meaning making_ into your object-space?

## Issue 5

I got nothing out of this theory in the form of knowledge in order to make better life decisions that are aligned to my values.

## Experience

Despite all of this questionable value and coherence of the theory, I have become to notice some people being obviously level 3 by Kegan's theory. It is quite fascinating they not have a _governing self_, but rather draw all of their values from other influencers by the looks of it. Everything they do seems to be only in order to satisfy the influencers' views, rather than understanding they don't really need to conform and can _Really Do Whatever You Want_.
