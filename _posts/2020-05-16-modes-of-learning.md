    I postulate that there are main two modes of learning - slow and steady stacking of strong information. And secondly, piling fast lots of weak data to make good inferences from the whole.

## How I Reached This Insight

I have two types of friends. There's one that doesn't believe anything you say unless it is backed by verifiable evidence or comes from a reputable source. Then there's another, that listens to what you say, and then based on their model of the world so far, gives either their view on it or counterarguments that might change my understand of it. But in the end, the first friend stays at his position if I haven't backed up my sayings with anything and the second friend has updated his perspective with my perspective and I have updated my perspective with his counterarguments.

I tried to get this point across to the first friend that there's other ways of acquiring knowledge and socializing with the intent of sharing knowledge than just giving strong information. 

I guess there are also parallels to be taken with people that hate smalltalk and people that use smalltalk as a probe to get the gist of the person before dwelling deeper into a topic.


## Strong Information Learning

The world is a difficult thing to make sense of and as such we need to use tools that simplify this and make it more comfortable for us to interact with. For this we've developed accurate communications methods (like maths), formal logic and also words to describe our certainty level and ways of referencing sources - e.g. _"I am almost certain that the name of the fungus [Spongiforma squarepantsii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spongiforma_squarepantsii) refers to the cartoon SpongeBob Squarepants."_

So when you hear me say this phrase, you can simply update your world model simply and without issues mostly, because you trust Wikipedia as a source of truth and you also acknowledge the likelihood of this being true due to the sheer strength of the similary of these words. 

Strong information learning also happens for instance when you learn financial analysis methods from a book, test it out in practice and validate it yourself. You have little doubt of its applicability or at the very least, its relation to reality.

If you learn something by heart, for instance the periodic table and the corresponding atomic masses - this would also account for strong information learning as you need very little surrounding context to know all this. It might not be very useful without context, but you can still _know_ this by heart and it might be useful in the future.

There are also people who use aspects of strong information learning only when it suits them in debates. For instance you say _"I hate pineapple"_  to a pineapple lover and then they try to to make you into a liar because you didn't specify how exactly is your relationship with pineapples. So they reply _"I've seen you buy and eat pinapple and say you enjoyed it!"_. Yes, that might be also correct. When you said you _"hate pineapple"_ you really meant that almost every time it is canned pineapple and on pizza, which are the most frequent forms of pineapple. But still, you said something _true_, but not something that could be incorporated to the other's knowledge base about you because they couldn't take it at word value - they needed it to be more specific. This might often come across as them not trusting you.

Strong information learning can also be seen as building the world model bottom-up rather than top-down, but is fairly limited to what is actually stackable on top of the existing model. 

## Weak Information Learning

In contrast to strong information learning, weak information learning relies on a top-down buildup of a world model. This is more like building loosely related _air castles_ of information and sometimes being able to connect them to each other. The building blocks for these are various sources of information, both weak and strong, but most of all - plenty, so nothing will stay amiss and everything is incorporated that isn't immediately obviously discardable. 

With weak information learning you can incorporate gazillion sets of weak information interlaced together to create a decent model of reality. You can also entertain silly ideas honestly, openly splurt out opinions just to get validation or disapproval for the ideas, making the model more accurate in the process. The key here is the amount of information incorporated, rather than just using strong and verified information to update your knowledge base.

This mode of learning works best with most people in casual conversations as you cannot back up everything with sources all the time, or even barely remember where you got your ideas from. But it naturally does not work with people very well who are mainly strong information learners as you are being way too vague and seemingly just bullshitting if you have more uncommon beliefs. 

Weak information learning is good for exploring and running around different topics until you get to a point where you're more interested and perhaps want to know more deeply about. It is also a good way to explore in debates where you disagree with the other person, in order to pinpoint where you differ in your fundamental beliefs. 

You can also have productive and useful conversations with people who are [good faith actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_faith) who are speaking truth and want to explore topics together and share knowledge with each other, where you aren't attacked on your potentially inaccurate statements (because you are honestly telling the truth and one point does not matter in a whole).
