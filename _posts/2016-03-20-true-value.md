## Values

Have you figured out what life goals are worth pursuing? Where did you get them? 

Were they drawn from your values? But where did you get these values from?

Well, it's a mixture of your genes, including the environment that has created and shaped these values. You have learned to cherish some values, perhaps even condemn some. But why would these necessarily be the ones that define your life (as you strive towards having more of these)?

I don't think I am personally okay with this. It seems like we spend most of our lives chasing for more of these values (like _fun, beauty, love_), but are they _fundamentally_ the sort of values we should be going after? We don't usually even internalize how we've obtained them or whether we could be wrong about these, or that there might be a particular value even greater to come.

So what has this sort of _true_ value for us?

## True Value

I think it is safe to say that we don't really know whether _fun_, _beauty_ and _love_ are really **the** values we're truly after (if we knew better), even after decades of thought, life, experience, knowledge.

Do we know anything that has certain value for us, that isn't just chosen based on some aspects based on who were our ancestors and how we grew up? I don't know any and am very skeptical of whether anyone knows this (yet).

There's even no evidence to consider one value over another - e.g. _love_ being more important than _fun_. Or even _beauty_ over _the ability to stretch your arms really high after a long day at work_.

In order to maximize the expected true value of our life, we should first find out what is that true value that we want to maximize! But since we don't know what this would be yet, then until that moment the only sure bet that increases this expected value - **more time**! 

(Sadly, as it is with expected values, there might not _actually_ be any value found anywhere. Also I apologize to the readers who argue that finding true value in life is a malformed problem proposition - by true value I mean a non-random value you'd hold in a nonzero positive regard given you have actually found it. I, for one, have no evidence to assign a higher probability mass to there _not_ being a true value. Is there evidence?)

So - how do we get more time?

## Some Examples of Activities for Maximizing Expected Value

Whatever keeps the human species alive is a good place to start for maximizing the expected value. That would mean working on minimizing [existential risks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_catastrophic_risk). If we're dead, that means we have no time at all.

Another thing is maximizing the lived hours of humans as whole. One way would be to just increase the population, but it is hard to provide enough resources for everyone to able to utilize their full potential.

We could also use the existing human capital and trying to maximize its output towards humanity's goals (i.e. finding this _true_ value). Naturally, not everyone wants to be a part of it and we shouldn't really force anyone either, but changing the culture to be more supportive towards aligning oneself to humanity's goals would be quite welcome. Right now it seems more like a vocation rather than something taken in high regard, as far as I have seen. I think it'd be neat if we could align _status_ to that. Beside improving culture, possibilities include intelligence research and generally [raising the sanity waterline (because it's really really low)](http://lesswrong.com/lw/1e/raising_the_sanity_waterline/).

And then there's the immortality research. Extending the humans' healthy lifetime not only gives them more _time_, but also it gives people the power to reach higher heights when it comes to research, if you can build on even more decades or eventually even hundreds years of experience. Right now people tend to have at most only a few decades of useful work per lifetime, and this is a huge limit to accumulating knowledge. Some of it is written down and passed on, true, but reacquiring this knowledge as a _'new'_ person takes a lot of time, effort and is prone to errors in communication and cognition, including the lack of background experience that the original owner of these ideas might have had.

## Final Thoughts

As disclosure, how I got to this idea was that someone was arguing for the case that nothing has any expected value right now except for immortality research and that people are wasting their lives on some bullshit that they've learned to value from their environment, but not really working on things that are truly fundamentally valuable.

I, however, find that immortality research, although super important, isn't the only thing we can do right now to help the cause. If we consider we can go from maybe 80-year average lifespan to immortality not gradually, but almost instantly, then it definitely has the highest expected utility, but right now the only way I see that happening is through friendly superintelligent AI, but there's more confusion than clarity around the plausibility of that.

Even though most of us are already entangled in whatever we're already doing and cannot really optimize for providing maximum value for humanity, I believe there's a growing amount of people who reason from first principles and would really like to build their skills, personality and career around what is actually most important. I think it's paramount that we find what that is, at least probabilistically.

Can you put your main activities in the context of aligning yourself to humanity's goals? Or, alternatively, have you thought of it in an individulistic context?
