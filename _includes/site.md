## Content

In this blog I dissect beliefs that I hold, including ideas that interest me. I am not completely sure of this format yet, but I have wanted to write in this style for ages already, so we'll see how it goes.

I aim to make my posts as readable and with as good flow as possible, while trying to be accurate and unassuming.

Since the posts represent my beliefs and ideas, so will _they_ be updated accordingly as new information comes in. Thus, feel free to let me know if I am wrong about anything!
