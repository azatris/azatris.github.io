## What Have I Done

I was born in Estonia. Also studied there until I went to The University of Edinburgh in Scotland where I studied Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence. Also did an exchange year in National University of Singapore. 
Former I recommend highly, latter I recommend to avoid.

## What Do I Do

Now I am back in Estonia, working at Skype (Microsoft) as a Software Engineer, which right now entails Azure services development using C#, scripting and devops.

In my free time I hang out with friends, read books, write stuff, watch movies, listen to _a lot_ of music, and participate actively in the rationality community (which circles around a diaspora of blogs, e.g. [LessWrong](http://lesswrong.com/), [Slate Star Codex](http://slatestarcodex.com/), [Gwern](http://www.gwern.net/), to name a few).

## What Do I Look Like

Here's a picture of me though a deep neural network that tried making it artsy.
